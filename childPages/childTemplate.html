            <article class="auto-style7">Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. You can play on several devices such as your Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, iOS, Android and also the PlayStation 5 and best of all the game is free-to-play!!!. Boring facts aside Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations. Now it may sound a little boring but it's because the good events in the game come in later and I hate spoiling stories so I can't tell you much more unfortunately :(</article>
